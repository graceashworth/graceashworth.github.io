            <h3>The Basics</h3>
            <p>Every life experience has shown me the importance of empathy. Being committed 
                to understanding not only myself but those around me has shaped the way I view
                every triumph and trialâ€”as a learning lesson to help foster my growth as an individual 
                who is committed to being a lifelong learner.</p>
            <p>I'm currently a junior at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor (Go Blue!)
                My curiosity for technology's impact on our society has led me to pursue a dual degree in Information Analysis 
                & Honors Sociology with a minor in Computer Science. Prior to attending Michigan, I 
                transferred from Fordham University at Lincoln Center in New York City. After undergrad, I plan to pursue 
                a Juris Doctor degree focusing on technological litigation.</p>

            <h4>Outside of School</h4>
            <p>I enjoy the smaller things in life: writing letters to my dear friends, going for aimless 
                drives (or walks), listening to curated Spotify playlists, and discussing the sociological implications 
                of every interaction I've ever had in my life (maybe it's just anxiety)! I love stand-up comedy and am 
                convinced I could write a hit satirical memoir one day in the future.</p>
            <p>I adore anything pertaining to music, having been to over 30+ concerts and on average, listening to 92,000 minutes of 
                music in the past year. My favorite albums recently have been Definitely Maybe by Oasis, Freetown Sound by Blood Orange,
                What's Wrong With New York by The Dare, Fear of Music by Talking Heads, and Chromakopia by Tyler, The Creator.
                My favorite concert memory is seeing the Arctic Monkeys at the Kings Theater in Brooklyn, New York. No phones were 
                allowed as it was a private performance of their latest album before its release date. 
                Fun fact: Alex Turner got me sick, but it was worth it.
